## Event-triggered filtering
**This is a repository of the codes for event-triggered H-infinity filtering [1] for nonlinear systems.**

### The codes are created using MATLAB software
The attached file consists of the following files:
 1. DoSData.m   ------------------  DoS attack data governed by Bernoulli are generated.
 2. DoSData.mat  -----------------  DoS attack data are saved in this file. The data are loaded in the following four files.
 3. ProgExample1.m  --------------  Simulaton results of example 1 under adaptive event-trigger can be obtained.
 4. StaticEventExample1.m --------- Simulaton results of example 1 under static event-trigger can be obtained.
 5. ProgExample2.m   --------------   Simulaton results of example 2 under adaptive event-trigger can be obtained.
 6. StaticEventExample2.m --------- Simulaton results of example 2 under static event-trigger can be obtained.
 
Note that: 
1) Simulation results of example 1 can be obtained by running ProgExample1.m and StaticEventExample1.m directly.
2) Simulation results of example 2 can be obtained by running ProgExample2.m and StaticEventExample2.m directly.
