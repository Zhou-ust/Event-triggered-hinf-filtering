The compressed file consists of the following files.

(1) DoSData.m              DoS attack data governed by Bernoulli are generated.

(2) DoSData.mat            DoS attack data are saved in this file. The data are loaded in the following four files.

(3) ProgExample1.m         Simulaton results of example 1 under adaptive event-trigger can be obtained.

(4) StaticEventExample1.m  Simulaton results of example 1 under static event-trigger can be obtained.

(5) ProgExample2.m         Simulaton results of example 2 under adaptive event-trigger can be obtained.

(6) StaticEventExample2.m  Simulaton results of example 2 under static event-trigger can be obtained.


Simulation results of example 1 can be obtained by running ProgExample1.m and StaticEventExample1.m directly.

Simulation results of example 2 can be obtained by running ProgExample2.m and StaticEventExample2.m directly.
